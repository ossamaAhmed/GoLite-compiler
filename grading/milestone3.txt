• Pretty cool idea to use your peephole optimizer with your GoLite
  project: synergy!
• It's perfectly fine to have one .go file generate multiple .j files; I
  believe that the Scala compiler generates a .class file per class,
  object or lambda in a file, so one .scala file can generate dozens of
  .class files.  Also, classes are the right fit for structs in the JVM,
  so you should definitely go with that.
• For declarations with an assignment, the right-hand side could be an
  arbitrary expression.  Your pattern needs to be more general.
• In your final report, it'd be nice if there were more details on the
  extra data structures and passes needed in order to generate JVM
  bytecode (e.g. a map from variable names to local slots, a pass to
  compute the baby stack height, etc.)  Laurie will certainly ask you
  about that in the meeting.
