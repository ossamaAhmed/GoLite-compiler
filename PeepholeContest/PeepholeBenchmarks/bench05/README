GROUP-I benchmark: a really (really!) simple dungeon generator

This generator take a list of variables in input to generate the dungeon and
output the layout of the dungeon (and it contained objects) in ASCII.

== The input looks like:

Room
10
6
Monster
4
5
Treasure
3
2
Upstairs
8
6
Hero
1
1
Monster
9
6
Treasure
7
3
Monster
5
5
Monster
2
1
Upstairs
6
4


== The output looks like:                                                                     
                                             
+----------+
|HM        |
|  T       |
|      T   |
|     U    |
|   MM     |
|       UM |
+----------+


* M == monster, T == treasure, U == upstairs, D == downstairs, H == hero.


== How to run ?

$ make
$ java DungeonGenerator < input.txt > output.txt

Note: The external librairies are included because we added some methods.


Have fun!
