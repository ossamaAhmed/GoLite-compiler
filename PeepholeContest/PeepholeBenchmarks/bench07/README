Welcome to GrueHunt!

This is a simplified text adventure game.
To navigate from room to room, use commands such as "north", "go south", "go up", etc.
You can usually interact with a room with an appropriate verb, but "interact" will always do the default action if you cannot find the right word.
All commands should be lower-case, and the text interpreter is very basic, so be careful with spelling.
You can also collect coins and treasure, and have a limited amount of health. You can "show hp", "show treasure", and "show coins" to see how many/much you have left.
Included in this package is a sample in1 file containing some typical commands. This generated game will probably end in death.
If you would like to give up, just type "give up".

To compile this game in java, just run the "make" command!
To compile using joosc instead, just run "make joos".
You can use "make gen" to generate a random in1 file.
To use the sample input file and output to a file, use
    java GrueHunt < in1 > out1
To run a sample generation, playthrough, and see the outcome of the game, you can run:
    make gen && java GrueHunt < in1 > out1 && tail out1

Good luck, and don't let the grues bite.
