Introduction
------------

The program is an interpretor of a subset of LOLCODE[1]. More specifically, it
only supports commands included in file "in1"

Implementation
--------------

The program includes:

    + Main.java - Reads LOLCODE from standard input.
    + Interpretor.java - Run every LOLCODE command.
    + StringEscapeUtils - Implement part of LOLCODE's string escape rules.

Comment
-------

The original plan is to generate parser by SableCC2, but it requires too much
effort to convert all generated java code to JOOS.
